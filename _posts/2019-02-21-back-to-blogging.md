After a number of years away, I finally got around to setting up a
blog again. I’ve been motivated to do this for a number of reasons:

- I grow increasingly impatient with the various 800 pound gorillas of
the Internet trying to herd everyone into their walled gardens, and
then laying claim to everyone’s content. To add insult to injury, it
seems that they are often also
[quite careless with your data](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/21/quit-facebook-privacy-scandal-private-messages). This is counter
to the
[original intent of the Internet](https://inrupt.com/blog/one-small-step-for-the-web), IMHO. A pair of accomplished writers that I know,
[Steve Stroh](https://www.stevestroh.com/) and
[Steve Roberts](https://microship.com/), inspired me to fight the
trend and go back to self-publishing.

- As with personal computing, I miss the days when people could
understand the whole technology “stack”, from keyboard to monitor, to
memory, to CPU, and back. Nowadays, most things are filled with
inscrutable black box components that are often proprietary. I feel
like a static blog like this one (based on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
and [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)) gives me a
fighting chance of understanding what’s going on.

- [Github’s offer](https://pages.github.com/) to host people’s web pages
(within reason) for free lowered the costs and barriers to entry to the
point that it literally took less than 15 minutes to setup and start a blog.
