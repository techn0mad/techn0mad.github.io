      <h1>Another New Blog?</h1>
      <div><h1>A Moving Target</h1>
<p>Here we are in another new year with not enough blogging going on, and
I am somewhat dismayed to find that the platform that this blog is based
on (<a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>) is now apparently in <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/09/14/future_of_jekyll_project_engine/">trouble</a>.
The primary developer and maintainer passed away and people are
now wondering how active the ecosystem will remain going forward.</p>
<p>I did some quick research to find out that in the bubbling, boiling churn
that is web development technology, some interesting new players have
emerged, one called <a href="https://nextjs.org/">next.js</a> in particular.
It is interesting in that it is based on <a href="https://www.javascript.com/">Javascript</a>,
which seems to be <em>the</em> programming language for
the web these days. But, enough about the details for now. The focus of
this post is to capture some basic requirements for a new blog implementation</p>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Simplicity: One should not have to know a dozen or more tools and framworks in a <a href="https://tutorials.yax.com/articles/the-yax-way/index.html">&quot;stack&quot;</a> to deploy the blog.</li>
<li>Standalone: The blog should be self-contained and not rely on any third-party (dynamic) services.</li>
<li>Static: The blog content should be completely derived from the contents of it's git repo (with the possible exception of comments).</li>
<li>Understandable: It should be clear how the site is finally rendered.</li>
<li>GitHub hosting: Let GitHub handle backup, availability, monitoring, etc.</li>
<li>Markdown formatting: It's hard enough to write in the first place without having to worry about some peculiar markup system.</li>
<li>Simple management of code snippets and graphics: This blog is primarily a place to store my technology-based ramblings.</li>
<li>Commenting: The ability to allow readers to respond would make the blog more dynamic and indicate whether the contents were proving to be of any value to anyone.</li>
<li>Workflow: Where possible, follow the <a href="https://jamstack.wtf/#workflow">Jamstack</a> workflow for development and deployment.</li>
</ul>
