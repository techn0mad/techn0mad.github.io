      <h1>Squishy RF</h1>
      <div><h1>Another Sad Story of Common Mode</h1>
<p>I have been running a <a href="http://kiwisdr.com/">KiwiSDR</a> for a number of years
since I arrived on Orcas Island.  When it was first set up with a nice
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverage_antenna">Beverage antenna</a>
running East-West (thanks Teresia and Kyle!) many people commented on how
useful it was and how well they could hear things on it.</p>
<p>The years have gone by, and for various reasons, the antenna no longer
qualifies as a Beverage, just a random wire, and it seemed like the
SDR wasn't working too well anymore. Doing a quick check seemed to indicate
that it only seemed to be receiving on the lower bands and MW/LW.</p>
<p>One of the fascinating things about the KiwiSDR is that it seems to be
half test equipment and half radio. The
<a href="http://rx.linkfanel.net/snr.html">built-in SNR measurement capability</a>
seems to be taylor-made to drive people crazy trying to
improve their &quot;scores&quot; and move up the list (although I'd tend to
remove any sites that do <em>not</em> filter out the MW band, because
all of those nation-wide advertising emissions just drive up the &quot;S&quot; in
&quot;SNR&quot;).</p>
<p>Since I'm planning to do a more &quot;permanent&quot; and &quot;professional&quot; installation
of a new Beverage antenna this fall, and I also have a brand new, never
installed <a href="https://www.wellbrook.uk.com/loopantennas/pdf/ALA100LN-M.pdf">Wellbrook active loop antenna</a>,
on this past weekend I decided it was time to bring in the feedline and see
what shape it was in.</p>
<h2>DC Checks</h2>
<p>Basic continuity tests showed that things were in order. Shield resistance
of the ~400 feet of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RG-6">RG-6 equivalent</a>
was ~0.1 ohm. Center conductor to center conductor was ~1.3 ohms.</p>
<h2>RF Ingress</h2>
<p>This is where we use the receiver to check the cable. The waterfall display
for the KiwiSDR is amazingly useful for this. We set the &quot;span&quot; to 0-4 MHz
and then check if we see anything. Considering we have a feedline connected
to nothing, we shouldn't see anything. Reality looks a bit different:</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>As usual, this probably boils down to
<a href="https://groups.google.com/g/rec.radio.shortwave/c/O4NvXCQT748/m/OrJkJ7aL3hwJ">common mode noise</a>
getting introduced into the system. As the feedline is also very long, and
our ground here on &quot;the rock&quot; is very poor, it's acting as an antenna too.</p>
<p>When all cables are removed (&quot;No input&quot; above), we don't see any signals,
so that rules out ingress via power, Ethernet, or GPS Antenna lines.</p>
<p>The biggest difference seems to come from adding the
<a href="https://cdn3.bigcommerce.com/s-4q7cv/product_images/uploaded_images/59f4efa62cbf4-1116d-choking.jpg">common mode choke</a>,
which increases the impedance along the shield of the coax to non-differential (i.e.
common mode) signals. This greatly reduces the endless amounts of EMI/RFI &quot;cruft&quot;
from stuff in the shack getting out anywhere near the antenna end of the feedline.
Even so, a few of the local MW broadcasters and a lot of LW &quot;hash&quot; can still be
seen. Really serious persons would introduce a second common mode choke at the antenna end
of the feedline and perhaps add a separate ground connection there too.</p>
<p>The next test will involve replacing the ~400 foot feedline with one that is
no more than ~200 feet long, as this is the limit for powering the Wellbrook
loop via the coax. Also, it would probably be good to get some serious
<a href="http://audiosystemsgroup.com/GroundingAndAudio.pdf">bonding and grounding</a>
going on in the shack too.</p>
