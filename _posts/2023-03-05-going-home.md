After having [picked up my new truck]({% post_url
2023-03-03-rivian-delivery %}), it was time to take it home.  My wife
drove her Subaru, and I drove the new truck to the Anacortes ferry
terminal, on a much nicer day than the previous two.

We started our trip in Sammamish, drove west on the WA-520, then went
north on the I-405, and then on the I-5, and finally west again on
WA-20. I started with about 230 miles of range, and arrived home with
about 110 miles of range remaining. I'm not sure what accounts for the
10-20 mile discrepancy in range, maybe I was playing around too much
:-)
