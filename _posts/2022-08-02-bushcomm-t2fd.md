After many years of carrying my 
[Bushcomm FD-100](https://www.bushcommantennas.com.au/brochurelibrary/Bushcomm%20FD-100%20%20Folded%20Dipole%20hf%20antenna%20broadband%20stainless%20steel.pdf)
[tilted, terminated dipole (T2FD)](http://www.hard-core-dx.com/nordicdx/antenna/wire/t2fd.html) antenna around, I finally got around to putting it up, sort of.

I haven't had much time to check it in detail but it seems to be working pretty
much as advertised: Some simple tests with a VNA show that the VSWR is less than
about 1.7:1 across the entire HF spectrum:

Compare this with a similar VNA scan of my 80M/40M fan dipole, where the VSWR is greater
than 2:1 across most of the HF spectrum:

I'm not satisfied with the orientation of the antenna, since one end is about
50-60 feet up but the other end is only about 3 feet off the ground. I'd like
to get at least one end up closer to 80-90 feet, and either get the other end
up high enough to produce the proscribed 30 degree tilt, or get the whole
antenna horizontal.
