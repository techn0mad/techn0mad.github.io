After a number of years away, I finally got around to setting up a
blog again. I’ve been motivated to do this for a number of reasons:

- I grow increasingly impatient with the various 800 pound gorillas of
the Internet trying to herd everyone into their walled gardens, and
then laying claim to everyone’s content. This is counter to the
original intent of the Internet, IMHO. An accomplished writer and
acquantance of mine, Steve Roberts, inspired me to fight the trend and
go back to self-publishing.

- As with personal computing, I miss the days when people could
understand the whole technology “stack”, from keyboard to monitor, to
memory, to CPU, and back. Nowadays, most things are filled with
inscrutable black box components that are often proprietary. I feel
like a static blog like this one (based on Jekyll and Ruby) gives me a
fighting chance of understanding what’s going on.

- Github’s offer to host people’s web pages (within reason) for free
lowered the costs and barriers to entry to the point that it literally
took less than 15 minutes to setup and start a blog.
