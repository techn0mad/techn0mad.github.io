After spending a few hours with the older ghpsdr software for the
HPSDR hardware, I was quite underwhelmed. It took a bit of detective
work to figure out how to run the newer ghpsdr3 software (QtRadio in
particular), but once I got it running, it's the bomb! I'm able to
trivially run multiple sub-receivers in the same sampling band, and
the waterfall performance is _much_ better than ghpsdr. It doesn't
hurt that conditions are fabulous on the 8 MHz aero band tonight.
