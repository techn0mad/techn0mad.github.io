<p>At long last I finally got my static site generator for this blog working, using <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>,
<a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, <a href="https://bitbucket.org/product">Bitbucket Cloud</a>, and
<a href="https://www.kattare.com/webhosting.kvws">Kattare Web Hosting</a>.
I'd been thinking about this for about a year and a half and I finally scraped together enough minutes to get it done. I hope that
for several reasons, it will be a simple, easy to maintain system:</p>
<ul>
<li>Content written in Markdown, using any text editor</li>
<li>No frontend/backend to maintain, no database or complex CMS system needed</li>
<li>No active scripting, so less chance of having security issues</li>
<li>Publishing is as simple as git commit, git push</li>
<li>Even though tools are not WYSIWYG, it should be easier to focus on the content rather than the tools</li>
</ul>
<p>I was able to import pretty much all of the posts from the old Wordpress blog, but I didn't save all of them. I deleted a lot that
were really just webpage bookmarks and other stuff that wasn't relevant anymore.</p>
