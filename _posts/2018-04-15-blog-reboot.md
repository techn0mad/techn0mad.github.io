![Jekyll Sticker]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/jekyll-sticker.jpg)

At long last I finally got my static site generator for this blog
working, using [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/),
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [Bitbucket
Cloud](https://bitbucket.org/product), and [Kattare Web
Hosting](https://www.kattare.com/webhosting.kvws).  I'd been thinking
about this for about a year and a half and I finally scraped together
enough minutes to get it done. I hope that for several reasons, it
will be a simple, easy to maintain system:

- Content written in Markdown, using any text editor
- No frontend/backend to maintain, no database or complex CMS system needed
- No active scripting, so less chance of having security issues
- Publishing is as simple as git commit, git push
- Even though tools are not WYSIWYG, it should be easier to focus on the content rather than the tools

I was able to import pretty much all of the posts from the old
Wordpress blog, but I didn't save all of them. I deleted a lot that
were really just webpage bookmarks and other stuff that wasn't
relevant anymore.
