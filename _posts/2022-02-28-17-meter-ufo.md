*<center>Super-wide "alien" signal just above 17M band</center>*

I have read a few articles about the hyper-competitve world
of high-frequency trading, and how a few milliseconds of
network latency might cost millions of dollars.

Apparently some of these enterprising traders have gone off
and setup some rather sophisticated HF data links to bypass
the whole Internet and flash their trades from here to Europe
on HF.

I don't know that this signal, that I've seen multiple times
just above the amateur 17 meter band (and also above the 20
meter band), is one of these traders or not, but it's a remarkable
signal considering that it is almost 50 kHz wide and quite 
strong. I would guess that the transmitter power is in the range
of 10 to 50 kilowatts to produce this kind of signal.
