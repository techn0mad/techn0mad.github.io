A well-known challenge for DIYers and homebrewers who want to work
with ferrite components is that most of the time, these components do
not carry markings or labels on the ferrites themselves, and the type
of ferrite is usually critical for a particular use.

There are lots of [articles](https://youtu.be/Q95Vwk3kZok) describing
how to use a grid-dip meter or VNA to determine what kind of ferrite
is being examined when they are encountered at a flea market or are
otherwise of unknown providence. Unfortunately, these steps are finicky
and require one to carry a bunch of test equipment around with them
(and know how to use it).

A simpler, more direct solution is to mark the ferrites when you
obtain them in a way that is both easy to read and difficult to
remove. Unfortunately, most ferrites are difficult to mark with
conventional pens or markers since they are usually a mix of ferrite
or iron power and ceramic, and are hard, brittle, and non-porous.

Fortunately, my wife is a potter, and glazed pottery and porcelain has
many of the same issues with respect to applying markings to it, but
people have come up with [solutions](https://artistro.com/products/white-paint-pens-for-rock-painting-stone-ceramic-glass-wood-set-of-5-acrylic-paint-markers-extra-fine-tip) to the problem:

This marker is white, so the markings stand out well against a black
background, and it actually uses paint to mark the item, so the
markings are both durable and difficult to remove.
