Back in mid-2021, I heard about an
[electric vehicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle)
(EV) startup named "[Rivian](https://rivian.com/)",
who piqued my curiosity, as they were building an exciting EV
truck targeted towards off-road users, but was also a luxurious,
sporty vehicle while on-road.

While many people are motivated by the ecological or "green"
aspects of EVs, I was more attracted by the exceptionally
conservative engineering of the R1T, and how thoroughly
Rivian had "wrung" it out before bringing it to market:
Driving it from
[Patagonia to Los Angeles](https://www.thedrive.com/news/35528/rivian-sent-two-r1t-electric-pickup-prototypes-on-a-13000-mile-trip-from-patagonia-to-la),
and driving it
[off-road from North Carolina to Oregon](https://www.motortrend.com/features/2022-rivian-r1t-exclusive-drive-review-trans-america-trail-off-road-ver-2/)
on the Trans-America trail.

I was also intrigued by the engineering personality of the
MIT-educated founder of the company,
[RJ Scaringe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._J._Scaringe),
and his obsessive drive to do something new and interesting
in the automotive world.

So, in October, 2021, I put down a deposit on a
[Rivian R1T](https://rivian.com/r1t)
truck that would be delivered at some indeterminate time in
the next year or two.

Fast forward to January, 2023: I finally hear back from
Rivian indicating that I had been assigned a VIN for a truck
and that I should expect delivery within 6-8 weeks.

At this point, I got in touch with Rivian and indicated that
all of this was all well and good, but that I had yet to see the
vehicle in person, much less drive it, and I wanted to arrange
for a "First Mile" experience before plunking down the rest of
the not insubstantial price for this vehicle.

This is Rivian's marketing term for a test drive, and it gets
complicated. I live in Washington state, and apparently, in
order to give people a test drive in Washington, you need to
be a licensed dealer, which Rivian is not.

So I was given the option to go to Portland, OR to have my
test drive. I looked at the maps, and noted that going to
Portland would likely be an overnight trip for me, at the
least, and that Rivian had just opened their first "Service
Center" in Canada, in Vancouver, scarcely 100 miles away from
me.

So, I asked if I could take the test drive there, and Rivian
said they could arrange it.

My wife and I got on the ferry, went over to Anacortes, WA and
drove up to Vancouver, BC for a very pleasant day:

It took a few minutes to get used to the "one pedal" driving
mode where braking is done by the electric motors regenerating
electricity and feeding it back into the batteries. Once you
are used to it, it is very easy to drive without touching the
brake pedal, unless an emergency arises.

Our Rivian guide took us through many scenic parts
of downtown Vancouver and across the Lion's Gate Bridge
over to West Vancouver.

I found that the truck felt very solid and heavy,
which makes sense, because of all of the batteries,
this truck weighs as much as a 3/4 or 1 ton truck.

However, the massive horsepower overwhelms this weight
and the truck can scoot around like a sports car if
you push it.

*The verdict is in*

When we went back to the Rivian office, we got to see one
in the color I had ordered.
