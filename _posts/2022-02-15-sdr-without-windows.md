As a person who is a bit of a fanatic about software defined radio
(SDR), and a professional software engineer and open source software
afficionado, one of the first things I check out in a new SDR is what
systems the software runs on. Several notable SDRs at least
superficially only seem to support Windows. I own an FDM-S2 and a HF+
Discovery and as a result I do not get to use them much as I only boot
up my Windows computer a few times a year, usually under duress.

- [Microtelecom Perseus](https://www.microtelecom.it/en)
- [Elad FDM-S2](https://www.eladit.shop/en-gb/Ricevitore-SDR-FDM-S2-p209053137) et al
- [AirSpy HF+ Discovery](https://airspy.com/airspy-hf-discovery/)

I occasionally wonder what the state of support for this SDR hardware
is like on other platforms like Linux, MacOS, or FreeBSD.  This is a
brief summary of what kinds of non-Windows software supports these
SDRs.

Based on a casual inspection of much of this software, it appears that
one of the least "heavy" solutions might be
[OpenWebRx](https://www.openwebrx.de/), as it offloads much of the
graphics and audio processing to the end-user's web browser. However,
it does not support the Elad or the Perseus. I am pleased to see that
it is now generally available, after being locked up and operating
only at the [original development
site](http://websdr.ewi.utwente.nl:8901/).

Notwithstanding that, the [Soapy
SDR](https://github.com/pothosware/SoapySDR) software seems to be the
"Rosetta Stone" of much of this software, mediating interfaces and
protocols between dozens of types of SDR hardware and [GNU
Radio](https://www.gnuradio.org/) the does the heavy lifting.
