      <h1>A Swing and a Miss</h1>
      <div><p>After a long hiatus, I wanted to look into hosting a
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020430181259/http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiDesignPrinciples">Wiki</a>.
I ended up looking at some pages like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wiki_software">this</a>.</p>
<p>I wanted to meet the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data stored in the cloud, under version control (git)</li>
<li>Handles <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown formatting</a>, as well as code</li>
</ul>
<p>I came across <a href="https://tiddlywiki.com/">TiddlyWiki</a>, which is an amazing invention for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The wiki is written in <a href="https://www.javascript.com/">Javascript</a>, and since almost all modern web browsers are effectively just <a href="https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2018/10/03/javascript-and-the-inner-workings-of-your-browser/">Javascript VMs</a> these days, there is no need for any intermediate processing or interpretation</li>
<li>The wiki is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_(computing)">Quine</a>, which is an obscure computer science concept, whereby running a piece of code produces its own code as output</li>
<li>Therefore, deploying the wiki is as simple as loading the (single) Javascript file into a browser</li>
</ul>
<p>I was able to get it running hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>, but I found a few obstacles:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is no practical security available. The Wiki can be marked as read-only for everyone, or open for everyone.</li>
<li>As the Wiki grows, so does the Javascript file that contains it. This results in managing a large git blob, that gets slower and slower as more commits are made to it.</li>
<li>It does not really support Markdown formatted posts directly, and the Markdown plugin did not seem to be entirely compliant</li>
</ul>
