      <h1>The Broken Glass</h1>
      <div><p><img src="/assets/610.jpg" alt="The Broken Glass"></p>
<p>Struggling to enjoy my time with my buddy Java, who has just been diagnosed with Lymphoma. He's lived to a ripe old age in any case, but I'm still distressed to see him suffer and to contemplate his eventual departure.</p>
<p>For many months, I've been trying to enjoy my time with him as much as I can, but now the pressure to do so seems quite large.</p>
<p>I turn to Zen for help:</p>
<p>&quot;You see this goblet?&quot; asks Achaan Chaa, the Thai meditation master. &quot;For me this glass is already broken. I enjoy it; I drink out of it. It holds my water admirably, sometimes even reflecting the sun in beautiful patterns. If I should tap it, it has a lovely ring to it. But when I put this glass on the shelf and the wind knocks it over or my elbow brushes it off the table and it falls to the ground and shatters, I say, 'Of course.' When I understand that the glass is already broken, every moment with it is precious.&quot;</p>
