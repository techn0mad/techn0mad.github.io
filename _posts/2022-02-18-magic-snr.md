Thanks to several people who have taken it upon themselves to
[aggregate and report the data](http://rx.linkfanel.net/snr.html),
along with the ability of the [KiwiSDR](http://www.kiwisdr.com/)
to measure and report signal to
noise ratios, many people with KiwiSDRs are competing with their
stations to achive the highest SNR.

Looking at the data, it seems than an average station might achieve an
SNR of around 25 dB, a good station perhaps 30 dB, and superlative
installations over 35 dB.

Imagine then my surprise when habitually checking the list, I found a
station, [IW2NKE](http://iw2nke.ddns.net:8073/), reporting a SNR of 50
dB. Of course, I had to investigate this anomaly.  Looking at the IW2NKE
waterfall, I was stunned to see very strong signals on the regular
amateur radio and broadcast bands, and nothing in betweee, no noise, QRM,
or static crashes.

However, upon further investigation, I found out that this
installation seems to be different that many others: Selecting a
frequency in the amateur or broadcast bands works fine, but selecting
an "odd" frequency outside of those bands yields nothing, no audio.

I'm not sure how or if this is done with the KiwiSDR software, but
from a signal processing point of view, it seems clear that in
generating a signal to noise ratio, if you select portions of the
spectrum where signals exist, and ignore portions where only noise
exists, then your signal to noise ratio will improve.

Addendum: From the [KiwiSDR
manual](http://kiwisdr.com/quickstart/index.html#id-user-marker-masked):
