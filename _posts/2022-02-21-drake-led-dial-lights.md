*<center>Ice Blue LED Dial Lights in Drake TR-7</center>*

As radios that emerged in the mid-seventies, the [Drake 7
line](http://www.wb4hfn.com/DRAKE/DrakeArticles/InsideTheTR7/Inside_The_TR7-01.htm)
was a hybrid implementation that bridged the sixties radios that were
tube based in aluminum cases, and the future designs that were more
heavily IC-based.

LEDs were not so common, or inexpensive at the time, so for dial
lights the conventional automotive type 53 incandescent bulbs with
bayonet mounts were used. These bulbs were frequently used to
backlight automotive instrument panels, and combined with the dark
blue film on the back of the S-meter and VFO dial, these gave the
Drake 7 line its unique appearance.

As these kinds of bulbs are no longer being used in the automotive
industry, it is getting more and more difficult to find them. As a
result, many are producing replacements for incandescent bulbs using
LEDs. I bought some [from
Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/Serundo-Auto-3030Chips-Interior-Instrument/dp/B08P4BN41F/ref=sr_1_2)
a couple of months ago, and finally got around to installing them
today. I was anxious to see how they would look compared to the
incandescent bulbs.

I am pleased that they worked as advertised, but I think I might have
to find some way to diffuse the light a bit more, as there seem to be
hotspots in the pattern of light they emit, and they are a bit too bright.
