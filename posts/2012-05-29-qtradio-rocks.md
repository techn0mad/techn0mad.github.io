title: QtRadio Rocks!
---

After spending a few hours with the older ghpsdr software for the HPSDR hardware, I was quite underwhelmed. It took a bit of detective work to figure out how to run the newer ghpsdr3 software (QtRadio in particular), but once I got it running, it's the bomb! I'm able to trivially run multiple sub-receivers in the same sampling band, and the waterfall performance is _much_ better than ghpsdr. It doesn't hurt that conditions are fabulous on the 8 MHz aero band tonight.
