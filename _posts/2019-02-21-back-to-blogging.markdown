After a number of years away, I finally got around to setting up a blog again.
I've been motivated to do this for a number of reasons:

1. I grow increasingly impatient with the various 800 pound gorillas of the
Internet trying to herd everyone into their walled gardens, and then laying
claim to everyone's content. This is counter to the original intent of the
Internet, IMHO. An accomplished writer and acquantance of mine, Steve Roberts,
inspired me to fight the trend and go back to self-publishing.

2. As with personal computing, I miss the days when people could understand
the whole technology "stack", from keyboard to monitor, to memory, to CPU, and 
back. Nowadays, most things are filled with inscrutable black box components
that are often proprietary. I feel like a static blog like this one (based on 
Jekyll and Ruby) gives me a fighting chance of understanding what's going on.

3. Github's offer to host people's web pages (within reason) for free lowered
the costs and barriers to entry to the point that it literally took less than
15 minutes to setup and start a blog.
