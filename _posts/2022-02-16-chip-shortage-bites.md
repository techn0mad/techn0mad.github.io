Imagine my surprise when I set out today to make what used to be a
commodity purchase: A [Raspberry Pi
4](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/).
This is a device that used to cost about $50, and was available at
Walmart, Amazon, Target, practically everywhere.

Today, I see that the only ones available at Amazon are around $160.
Specialist suppliers like Adafruit and CanaKit are out of stock.

There was a minor uproar over the
[announcement](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/supply-chain-shortages-and-our-first-ever-price-increase/)
by the Raspberry Pi Foundation that they were forced to raise their
prices by $10 last October, but this situation seems to dwarf that.

It makes me wonder what particular parts they have been unable to
source. I expect that every company in the world that uses chips has
been scrambling to scrape up enough supply to get by, thanks to the
[global chip
shortage](https://spectrum.ieee.org/global-chip-shortage-charts).
