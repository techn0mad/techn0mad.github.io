All views expressed on this site are my own and do not represent the opinions
of any other entity with which I have been, am now, or will be affiliated.

Disclaimers
- Expressed views
- No responsibility (for availability of site, etc.)
- Use at your own risk
- Errors and omissions
- Fair use
- Copyright

Nature of your site – Let your readers know the nature of your site. A blog
differs from a website. A blog has ever changing content and can include
conversations and comments as compared with a website. This might seem
obvious, but it’s good to make it clear what type of site you are running.

Opinionated content – You should remind your readers that your blog contains
your opinions and doesn’t reflect the opinions of any organizations you might
be affiliated with. This helps to show that if, perhaps you work with a
certain company, you aren’t making official statements on behalf of that
company.

Terms of use – Indicate that any information you provide on your blog is
accurate and true to the best of your knowledge, but that there may be
omissions, errors or mistakes.

Hold harmless clause – This type of clause is where you remind your readers
    that the info you present on your blog is for entertainment and/or
    informational purposes only and shouldn’t be seen as any kind of advice,
    such a medical, legal, tax, emotional or other types of advice. You can
    again reiterate that if your readers rely on any info on your blog, it’s
    at their own risk.  Not a professional – Next, indicate that you are not a
    professional, if that’s the case. Therefore, you’re not a doctor, medical
    professional, health professional, tax professional, attorney, engineer,
    etc. Whatever the topic you’re writing about –remind everyone that you are
    not a professional so your info shouldn’t be seen as professional advice.

Are a professional, but… – If you are a professional for a topic that you’re
writing on, make sure you share that, but remind your readers of what that
means. Indicate that, even though you’re a professional, your blog posts are
for information purposes only and shouldn’t be seen as financial, health,
nutritional, medical, legal, etc advice. Also remind your readers to consult
with a professional before taking any sort of action.

Reservation of rights – In this section, you should indicate that you reserve
the right to change how you manage or run your blog and that you may change
the focus or content on your blog at any time.

Content Validity: A blog is always in transition. The information you publish
today might not be valid or accurate two weeks or two years from now. Content,
sources, information and links change over time, so make sure your protect
yourself from the natural evolution of blog content.

Content Accuracy: We all make mistakes. The disclaimer should take the
accuracy and validity of your blog’s content into account.

External Links: What you link to reflects back on your blog. I made the
mistake recently of publishing a link inaccurately, linking to a porn site. It
was quickly fixed, but mistakes happen. URLs and domains change hands. Protect
yourself in your blog’s disclaimer from what is at the end of a link, as well
as from those linking to you.

Photographs and Graphic Images: If you are using images that are not yours,
then say so. If they are, make sure you claim them and hold yourself harmless
from any harm caused by the images, such as offending someone.

Files, Programs, and Downloadables: If you offer downloadable files or
programs, such as WordPress Plugins, Themes, etc., make sure you get the
wording exactly right to protect yourself in case your file damages or harms
someone’s blog, site, or computer.

Libel and Defame: Be clear that anyone reading your blog will not hold you
libel for what you say or display. State the content on the blog is the
opinion of the blogger, not intended to “malign any religion, ethnic group,
club, organization, company, or individual,” or anyone or thing, especially
those with the ability and desire to fight back.

Responsibility: You should state that you are responsible for the content, not
your employer, volunteer group, membership organization, church, or other
agencies which you might be seen to represent. Take care with this. If you
volunteer for an organization, and blog about it, you could be seen to
“represent” it through implication, just as much as you might be representing
your employer if you write about the company and/or your work.

Personal Views: State that these are your personal views, which implies you
are responsible for them, not your employee or another agency. Your blog is
your opinion.

Protection from Commenters: Consider stating that you are not responsible, nor
will be held liable, for anything anyone says on your blog in the blog
comments, nor the laws which they may break in your country or theirs through
their comments’ content, implication, and intent.

Protection from Fellow Bloggers: If you have multiple bloggers and/or
contributors on your blog, consider some statement that covers them,
protecting them but also protecting you from what they say in their blog
posts.

Do No Harm: It helps when you say that your “intention” is to do no harm. To
not injure others, defame, or libel, just in case someone thinks you are doing
harm. “Harm” is subject to interpretation not facts. It’s your opinion and
advice, not counsel. What you write on your blog is not to be taken as fact
nor absolute. If people use your advice, tips, techniques, and
recommendations, and are injured, you are not to be held responsible.

Disclosure of Paid-to-Blog: Some disclaimers may include a disclosure
statement that says the blog’s content is, or is not, generated to make money
or paid for blogging content. If this is not included in the disclaimer, make
sure you publicly and visibly post a disclosure as there is a growing call for
blogger’s ethics for transparency.

Language Issues: I got in trouble in Israel for using the English word
“maniac” which translates into a “bad” word in Hebrew. Language is a tricky
thing, so consider adding a statement about not being responsible for
translation or interpretation of content. Also, if this issue is important to
you, you know that punctuation can change the intent of a statement, so hold
yourself and your blog harmless from prosecution for bad grammar and
punctuation.

Copyright: If you want to make your disclaimer a catch-all, be sure to include
a statement on your copyright policy, setting the guidelines for how and when
your content may be used by others.

International and Cultural Laws: If your blog is read by someone from another
country, a country which has laws which restricts or censors content, and your
blog’s content crosses their line, who is responsible for “crossing the
border”? Is it you or the reader? Either way, consider a statement that says
you are not responsible for defamatory statements bound to government,
religious, or other laws from the reader’s country of origin.

Limits on Damages: Consider adding a statement that restricts the financial
claim that could be taken against you and your blog. If legal action is
brought against your blog, it could be brought against you personally, your
home, properties, and more. By setting a cap limit on the financial
responsibility, it could help the courts set a lower rate if you lose, since
you publicly stated the limits.

Blog Disclaimer – Things I Take Responsibility For

Content:

This is a personal blog. All opinions expressed here are my own and not those
of anyone else. I am responsible for the content – not anyone else. If I ever
have an employer he/she would not be responsible. Any group, organization,
church, agency or entity that I may be associated with would not be
responsible either. It’s all about me, me, me, only me, and I like it that
way.

Mistakes and Stupidity:

I may make a mistake or say something stupid. Actually, chances are pretty
good that I’ll do both at some point. I’ll do my best to refrain from
stupidity (It’s ironic that I had to retype “stupidity” three times to get it
right) but I don’t make any promises. I’m only human and make mistakes just
like everyone else – probably more than everyone else. Waaay more. Just for
the record; any mistakes belong to me and me alone. Not that I want to claim
them but since they’re mine I’m kinda stuck with them.

Changing my Mind:
	
Over time my thoughts and opinions may change. In fact, Teacher will tell you
it’s a sure bet that I’ll change my mind – often. Posts are intended to give
insight into my life at the time the post is written, but not necessarily
forever. Current posts may express different opinions than earlier posts. We
do the best we can with what we know at the time, and as we learn more we do
better. Right?

Copyright:
	
Since most everything in the blog comes from my brain, it belongs to me. It’s
still all about me. But if you like a post feel free to link to it! You may
use a portion less than 1/3 if you’re going to be picky of a post as long as
you link to the original post and give me credit. If you want to use more than
1/3 of a post please contact me to request permission. I’ll probably say
“Sure, go ahead!” Thank you for respecting my intellectual and the
not-so-intellectual property.

Blog Disclaimer- Things I’m not Responsible for:

Eternal Accuracy:
	
The information in this weblog is provided “as is” with no warranties, and
confers no rights. I’ll do my best to make sure all the information, including
links, are accurate at the time of posting but there’s no guarantee that
information posted today will still be valid or accurate in the future.

Incoming Links:
	
I can’t control who links to me. If I could you can bet I’d be setting myself
up for some major PR juice! If you see a questionable site linking to my blog
take it up with them, not me. I don’t submit my blog to “link farms” or
directories so if they find me it was all on their own.

Personal Offense:
	
I promise to try my best not to not knowingly injure, defame, or libel
anyone. Posting that Aunt Mabel’s puce sweater is hideous doesn’t count cuz
that’s my opinion. Please don’t tell Aunt Mabel! If content matter, bad
grammar, slang or punctuation translates or is interpreted into something bad
in your country or culture it was certainly not my intent and I will not be
held responsible for it. If you’re bound and determined to find insult where
none was intended feel free to close the window and not return.

Bad Decisions:

My intention is to do no harm just like the witches in my favorite Nora
Roberts books but without the whole power thing. I’m not a doctor, lawyer,
therapist, trainer, chef, or any other type of trained expert so what I write
is not to be taken as fact nor absolute. Use your own brainpower instead of
mindlessly making decisions based on what I write. You won’t be compensated in
any way if you suffer a loss/damage/inconvenience because of something written
in this blog.

Making Money:

At one time I was 100% against accepting any money for writing on My Happy
Crazy Life. Then I had to renew the domain, pay hosting, and gasp! ran out of
coffee money all in the same month! After careful consideration I decided that
it was possible to fund my caramel macchiato habit while keeping my
integrity. For instance, the ads in the right sidebar will hopefully cover
yearly hosting and coffee expenses. Hosting is easy; it’s the coffee allowance
I’m worried about. I’m still against paid recommendations disguised as
personal opinion, so anything I rave about is because I want to share
something amazing with you – not because I was paid to say it. However, I’m
willing to consider sponsored posts if the product or service is one I’d
really truly use or have used and like. No matter what, I promise that
anything I write here is my own honest opinion – whether I’m getting coffee
allowance for it or not.

Comments:

Feel free to disagree with me or tell me I’m completely crazy in the comments
section of each blog entry. Please be polite because my feelings are easily
hurt. I reserve the right to delete any comment for any reason whatsoever –
like abusive, profane, rude, anonymous comments, and spam. Once a comment
passes moderation I won’t be held responsible for the contents of blog
comments. And I’m not responsible for any laws that may be broken in any
country through the content, implication, and intent of blog comments. Don’t
bother commenting just to spam your site cuz I’m on to you and will delete
your comment. I’ve heard that Viagra doesn’t work anyway. But if you’re
leaving an honest-to-goodness comment please link to your blog or site – I’d
love to see it!

Matching Socks: 

I may take responsibility for getting myself dressed every morning but I don’t
promise I’ll be wearing matching socks – sometimes two go in but only one
comes out.

This policy is valid from 23 February 2019


This blog is a personal blog written and edited by me. This blog does
not accept any form of advertising, sponsorship, or paid
insertions. We write for our own purposes. However, we may be
influenced by our background, occupation, religion, political
affiliation or experience.

The compensation received will never influence the content, topics or
posts made in this blog. All advertising is in the form of
advertisements generated by a third party ad network. Those
advertisements will be identified as paid advertisements.

The owner(s) of this blog is not compensated to provide opinion on
products, services, websites and various other topics. The views and
opinions expressed on this blog are purely the blog owners. If we
claim or appear to be experts on a certain topic or product or service
area, we will only endorse products or services that we believe, based
on our expertise, are worthy of such endorsement. Any product claim,
statistic, quote or other representation about a product or service
should be verified with the manufacturer or provider.

This blog does contain content which might present a conflict of
interest. This content will always be identified.

The Disclaimer

This is a weblog, most commonly referred to as a "blog". The opinions
and thoughts expressed here represent my own and are NOT those of my
employer, any associations, or any volunteer organizations I am a
member of.

In addition, my thoughts and opinions will change from time to
time. While some may see this as detrimental and may at times appear
hypocritical, it is a necessity to maintain an open minded mentality
which is in my (current) opinion more important than defending out
dated thoughts and opinions with voracity. Change is not automatically
a bad thing, but quite contrary a necessity in the grand scheme of
evolution as individuals, organizations, professions, and society as a
whole.
