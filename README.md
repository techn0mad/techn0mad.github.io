## Building locally

1. Open Terminal.

2. Navigate to the publishing source for your site. For more
   information, see "Configuring a publishing source for your GitHub
   Pages site."

3. Run `bundle install`.

4. Run your Jekyll site locally.

    $ bundle exec jekyll serve
    > Configuration file: /Users/octocat/my-site/_config.yml
    >            Source: /Users/octocat/my-site
    >       Destination: /Users/octocat/my-site/_site
    > Incremental build: disabled. Enable with --incremental
    >      Generating...
    >                    done in 0.309 seconds.
    > Auto-regeneration: enabled for '/Users/octocat/my-site'
    > Configuration file: /Users/octocat/my-site/_config.yml
    >    Server address: http://127.0.0.1:4000/
    >  Server running... press ctrl-c to stop.

Note: If you've installed Ruby 3.0 or later (which you may have if you
installed the default version via Homebrew), you might get an error at
this step. That's because these versions of Ruby no longer come with
`webrick` installed.

To fix the error, try running `bundle add webrick`, then re-running
`bundle exec jekyll serve`.

To preview your site, in your web browser, navigate to http://localhost:4000.
