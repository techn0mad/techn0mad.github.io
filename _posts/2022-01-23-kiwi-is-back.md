Last summer, I quickly threw together a ~10 M wire loop in order to finally test
my
[Wellbrook ALA100LN active antenna](https://www.wellbrook.uk.com/loopantennas/ALA100LN-M)
that I've had in a box for an embarassingly long time.

I was impressed with the performance when used with
[my KiwiSDR](http://kiwisdr.gadallah.net:8073/),
but alas, the antenna was far too close to my house, and at eye level from our
deck, so my XYL was complaining about the appearance of it.

In the meantime, we had some windstorms and between the trees and the ad-hoc
rigging I did on the antenna, it came down. That solved one of the problems.

Today, I finally put up a new antenna for the Wellbrook, a 15 M delta loop,
at about 15 M above the ground. It is a reasonable distance from the house 
now too, probably about 30-40 M away.

While I am most interested in enhancing the
[SNR of the antenna and KiwiSDR](http://rx.linkfanel.net/snr.html)
combination, and no doubt some more work is needed in that area,
I'm impressed in seeing some longwave broadcast carriers showing up from Europe
here on the west coast of the US. The
[BBC Droitwich outlet on 198 kHz](https://www.asiawaves.net/longwave-radio.htm#longwave-198)
was only a ghostly smear, but
[Iceland on 207 kHz](https://www.asiawaves.net/longwave-radio.htm#longwave-207)
was very clear. I'm pretty certain the
[French transmitter at Allouis on 162 kHz](https://www.asiawaves.net/longwave-radio.htm#longwave-162)
was coming through too, but apparently it only carries a time signal now.
The signal on 198 kHz is also interesting as it seems to show a pair of carriers 
very close together, which makes some sense as the 
[BBC has three transmitters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droitwich_Transmitting_Station)
throughout the UK on that frequency, so perhaps they are not perfectly 
synchronized.

More than likely none of these are at anywhere near listenable levels,
but with an SDR's waterfall display, the eye can pick out some amazingly weak
signals.
