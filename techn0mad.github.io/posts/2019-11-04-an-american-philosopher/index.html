      <h1>An American Philosopher</h1>
      <div><p>Recent political events made me contemplate these ideas, ascribed to
someone described as America's last great philosopher, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Hoffer">Eric
Hoffer</a>. Regardless of your
partisan or religious leanings, many of them seem to resonate strongly
in our time.</p>
<p>From Eric Hoffer's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_True_Believer"><em>&quot;The True Believer&quot;</em></a> (1951):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>&quot;Absolute faith corrupts as absolutely as absolute power.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Add a few drops of venom to a half truth and you have an absolute
truth.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;An empty head is not really empty; it is stuffed with
rubbish. Hence the difficulty of forcing anything into an empty head.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Faith in a holy cause is to a considerable extent a substitute
for lost faith in ourselves.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Far more crucial than what we know or do not know is what we do
not want to know.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;For many people, an excuse is better than an achievement because
an achievement, no matter how great, leaves you having to prove
yourself again in the future; but an excuse can last for life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Hatred is the most accessible and comprehensive of all the
unifying agents. Mass movements can rise and spread without belief in
a god, but never without a belief in a devil.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;It has often been said that power corrupts. But it is perhaps
equally important to realize that weakness, too, corrupts. Power
corrupts the few, while weakness corrupts the many. Hatred, malice,
rudeness, intolerance, and suspicion are the faults of weakness. The
resentment of the weak does not spring from any injustice done to them
but from their sense of inadequacy and impotence. We cannot win the
weak by sharing our wealth with them. They feel our generosity as
oppression.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Naivete in grownups is often charming; but when coupled with
vanity it is indistinguishable from stupidity.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Never forget that one of the most gifted, best educated nations
in the world, of its own free will, surrendered its fate into the
hands of a maniac.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;No matter how noble the objectives of a government, if it blurs
decency and kindness, cheapens human life, and breeds ill will and
suspicion--it is an evil government.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Our frustration is greater when we have much and want more than
when we have nothing and want some. We are less dissatisfied when we
lack many things than when we seem to lack but one thing.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Passionate hatred can give meaning and purpose to an empty life.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Propaganda does not deceive people; it merely helps them to
deceive themselves.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Rudeness is the weak man's imitation of strength.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Should Americans begin to hate foreigners wholeheartedly, it will
be an indication that they have lost confidence in their own way of
life.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;The hardest thing to cope with is not selfishness or vanity or
deceitfulness, but sheer stupidity.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;The opposite of the religious fanatic is not the fanatical
atheist but the gentle cynic who cares not whether there is a god or
not.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;The search for happiness is one of the chief sources of
unhappiness.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;To know a person's religion, we need not listen to his profession
of faith but must find his brand of intolerance.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;We can be absolutely certain only about things we do not
understand.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;We lie the loudest when we lie to ourselves.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;You can discover what your enemy fears most by observing the
means he uses to frighten you.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;You can never get enough of what you don't need to make you
happy.&quot;</p>
</li>
