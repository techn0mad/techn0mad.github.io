As the son of a [science fiction writer](http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/gadallah_leslie),
and someone who grew up in a family where everyone read science 
fiction, I am frequently embarrased at how little of it I get 
these days, whether I am not reading it or not watching it.

My family and I frequently lamented our shared perception that the 
genre kept getting watered down with stories that trended more towards
the fiction and less towards the science.

I recently stumbled across ["The Expanse"](https://www.syfy.com/theexpanse)
and I was quite delighted: I was attracted to the special effects 
that were not only dramatic but realistic: The 
[physics](https://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2016/03/10/469626620/the-expanse-best-science-fiction-show-in-a-decade) shown seems to match what would actually 
happen. People are floating inside a spaceship in deep space, and 
the engines start and the people are slammed into the wall. Except
for the biggest locations and the planets Earth and Mars, there is
not much gravity and many people are seen wearing magnetic boots 
so that they can traverse the (metal) interiors of their spaceships 
and hollowed out asteroids. It's nice to see someone paying attention
to the science in science fiction for a change.

I should hasten to ask that the other attractive part of the show
is that it is set in the relatively near future and does not
(initially) involve any far-fetched technology or god-like aliens or
mysterious omnipotent forces. There is a pretty elegant transposition
of the old west story to the asteroid belt at work here.
