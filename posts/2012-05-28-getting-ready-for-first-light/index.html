      <h1>Getting ready for &quot;First Light&quot;</h1>
      <div><p>When a telescope is commissioned, the first time light from the stars enters the instrument is called &quot;first light&quot;. While ham radios aren't telescopes, I'm getting quite excited at the notion of connecting an antenna to my HPSDR setup for the first time this long weekend.</p>
<p>Inexplicably, I've been sitting on the HPSDR hardware for well over a year now, and I finally got around to finishing the power supply (LPU) to run the whole thing. I've been trying to contain myself and take things one step at a time. I've gotten to the point where the LPU and Atlas are checking out okay. I'm glad I checked carefully; I found two resistors swapped on the LPU. I was quite impressed that I was able to remove and swap these 0603 SMT parts with nothing more than a pair of reading glasses to assist.</p>

<p>After a few hours of struggling with dueling DHCP servers, reading and re-reading the manuals, consulting the HPSDR mailing list archives, learning about board position and JTAG programming, and flashing the boards with the appropriate versions of their respective FPGA firmwares, I am at the point where the system runs well, for about 5 seconds. According to the LPU errata this is a problem with the SMT fuses on the LPU, so presumably I am only one hardware mod away from first light.</p>
