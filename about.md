## Disclaimer ##

### Liability for Content ###

The content of our websites was created with great care. We canâ€™t make any
guarantee as to the accuracy, completeness and timeliness of the content.
As a publisher we are responsible for the content of these pages according
to Section 230 of Title 47 of the United States Code. According to the
Communications Decency Act of 1996 we as service providers are not obliged
to monitor transmitted or stored information or to investigate circumstances
that indicate illegal activity. Responsibility for the removal or blocking
of the use of information under general legal provisions is unaffected.
A liability is only possible from the date of knowledge of a specific
infringement. Upon notification of such violations, we will remove the content
immediately.

### Liability for Links ###

Our site contains links to external websites over which we have no control;
therefore we cannot accept any liability for these websites. The respective
provider or operator is responsible for the content of the linked sites. The
linked sites were checked at the time of linking for possible violations, and
illegal content was not present at the time the link was set on our site. A
permanent control of the linked pages is unreasonable without concrete
evidence of a violation of law. Upon notification of violations, we will
immediately remove such links.

### Copyright ###

The content and other work on these websites are subject to copyright. The
reproduction, adaptation, distribution or any kind of exploitation outside
the limits of copyright require the written consent of the respective author.
Downloads and copies of these pages are only permitted for private,
non-commercial use. Insofar as the content on this site is created by the
operator, the copyrights of third parties are respected (in particular the
content of third parties is identified as such). Please notify us should you
become aware of any copyright infringement, and we will remove the content
immediately upon notification of any violations.
