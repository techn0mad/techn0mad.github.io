*<center>Beverage Headend</center>*

For some time, I have been trying to improve the
[SNR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal-to-noise_ratio) score
reported by my [KiwiSDR](https://kiwisdr.gadallah.net:8073).

During the first year I was living on Orcas Island, my friends helped
me put up a "temporary" [Beverage
antenna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverage_antenna) for Field
Day, and after Field Day, I connected it to my
[KiwiSDR](http://kiwisdr.com/). I got all kinds of reports of how
useful the SDR was and how quiet the antenna was, allowing people to
hear things they could not hear at home.

About a year ago, I had to take down the "temporary" antenna, and I
resolved to put up a more permanent Beverage antenna in its
place. After a number of steps, this past weekend I finally pulled all
of the pieces together and I now have a 220 meter long unterminated
Beverage antenna pointed NE, roughly at Europe.

As soon as I could, I connected the new Beverage to the KiwiSDR, and
this evening, after it had been connected for about 8 hours, I went to
the [KiwiSDR SNR aggregation page](http://rx.linkfanel.net/snr.html)
and was astonished to find that I had leapt far up the list. The best
showing I had seen in the past was perhaps 75th place (and more
commonly, 125th or so), and I saw that I was at number 10 out of
over 650. This number varies over time as conditions change, but I am
very pleased to see that the effort to put up the new antenna already
seems to be paying off.

*<center>A big leap up the list</center>*

The ranking shown on the page above is very deceptive, however: As the page
states, SNR scores are usually best early in the morning, because man-made
noise levels tend to be lowest then, and propagation on the higher HF
bands begins to fade in early in the morning, thereby reducing the "N"
and increasing the "S" in SNR. Depending on propagation conditions,
signals may be higher or lower, somewhat independent of local noise,
so I notice my position on the list varying wildly now; running from being
in the top 20, down to being where it used to be, around 120th or so.
