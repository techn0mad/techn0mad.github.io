At field day in 2017, some good friends volunteered to setup an ad-hoc
[Beverage antenna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverage_antenna) at
my QTH, running straight east-west for about 150 M. That antenna
stayed up for almost 5 years, despite being put together in a hurry. A
lot of that time, it was left connected to my [KiwiSDR
receiver](http://kiwisdr.gadallah.net:8073) and I got all kinds of
glowing reports of how well it worked and how quiet my site was.

I spent the afternoon today bushwhacking my way through some of the
less friendly, more impassable parts of my property to pull the wire
for a new Beverage, oriented SSE to NNE running for some 210 M. I
don't trust my orienteering skills, but I think the wire might have a
slight curve to the south, but fortunately, Beverage antennas are very
tolerant of this sort of thing and can be setup almost anywhere.

I used some highly recommended [wire from Davis
RF](https://www.davisrf.com/antenna-wire/polystealth.php). It is 18
gauge stranded copperclad steel wire, with a heavy polyetheline
jacket. So far, it appears both stealthy and indestructable.

Now I need to rebuild the matching transformer. I bought parts to do
this 5-6 years ago and never got around to it. I wanted to follow
[W8JI's recipe](http://www.w8ji.com/core_selection.htm) for the
roughly 9:1 step-down transformers needed for Beverage antennas. The
part I've been fixated on is finding some suitably small wire with a
tough jacket, like the Kynar wire that used to be used for wire-wrap
projects in the past.

Once this one is in place, I will take a stab at building a shorter
(120-150 M) one running orthogonal to this one, so I can get
reception from a few more directions.
